TODO:

[Bug] [Done]
*    Fix DoH drop

[Bug] [Done]
*    Re-Check Server Fetch and Fetch usage of compressed.

[Important]
*    Improve more the time-out and outbound or inbound connection firewall blocks

[Important]
*    At dial check config > than timeout usage. In some dial context the connection timeout may be split and become less based on how much addesses we have. do len / 2 >= addr or * the timeout to fix this. For the dial context timeout to be correct we need to have addresses * timeout.

[Completed]
*    Re-check: don't allow protocol connection drop only on some RSA security bypass.


[Completed]
*    Fix: xTransport Fetch manipulation with wrong TLS version server response

[Improvement]
*    Add: Force Post - Get Request and retries.

[Improvement]
*    Add: Control if we want to change cipher cuites after successfull connection and after how many failures

[Improvement]
*    Add get and try cipher suites in configuration order for TLS 1.2. Can do this by trying them 1 by 1 in order and then continue with the normal execution.

[Improvement]      
*    Don't drop on failed listen address if more than one exist and some is valid and recheck on successfull connection.
